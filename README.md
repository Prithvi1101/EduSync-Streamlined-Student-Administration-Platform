# EduSync-Streamlined-Student-Administration-Platform

For my 2-2 Database Management System course project, I built a Student Administration System. This system allows students, faculty, parents, and administrators to perform essential functions. The software used for this project includes HTML, PHP, CSS, and MySQL.
EduSync: Streamlined Student Administration Platform is designed to streamline the 
administrative tasks and provide a unified interface for students, faculty, parents, and 
administrators within an educational institution. The purpose of this project is to simplify 
the process of managing academic and administrative tasks, enhancing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the institution's operations. EduSync aims to improve the current system, 
making it more accessible and efficient for all users. This platform will enable better 
communication, data management, and reporting capabilities.
